It's a big question that I am not entirely sure how to answer.

There are two roads diverged (Two of Swords), and it seems like we are unsure how to make meaning of this. One world we could step into looks grimmer, while the other looks much brighter. But I also wonder if this appearance is deceiving. Someone is waiting in the more grim world. This may be too high level, but it makes me think about community and how a community is actually what creates our reality. There’s also a hand playing with a question mark, perhaps Fate? She’s pointing towards the grim world, and again, I wonder if Fate means we always come back to the community. Perhaps like memory, Fate is multidirectional and requires some aspect of a community.

She’s blocked in her vision. Maybe ignorance? She can only see and is looking in the opposite direction.
