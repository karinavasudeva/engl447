Placing Mandel’s reading in the context of the “Ten of Wands” is interesting. The card itself is quite simple: there is a faceless woman who is bearing the burden of many wands as she approaches a village (that seems a bit barren). It seems as she walks toward this village, the ten wands she possesses will become even more difficult to manage. I think this signifies a problem in our approach to language and complicity, as Mandel suggests. While the idea of not speaking the unspeakable seems like a good idea, it plays into society’s deep-seated complicity. In order for this faceless woman to move forward in her community, she must rid herself of these wands. To me, these wands represent the idea of not speaking the unspeakable. Only by speaking the unspeakable and confronting our complicity can the village she is moving towards becoming her reality. We can’t collectively come to an understanding (and a responsible one, at that) about what “after Auschwitz’ means without letting go of this idea.
