The Hermit. While this card frames spontaneous solitude in a positive light (resulting in peace, expression, etc), I remember the summer of 2020. I remember the pain of my chronic illness. I remember being unsure of what it meant to interact with people. I remember going through a transition, one that is often marked by a quick loss and gain. What made this a  unique summer was that I lost but did not gain anything. I experienced a spontaneous solitude but donâ€™t think I benefitted from it. While hermits travelled in solitude, I remained stagnant in solitude, which may be where the difference lies.
