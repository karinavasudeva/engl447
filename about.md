ENGL 447: Memory and Literature

This website serves as a repository of my extensive journaling and research project, with the intent to explore the organic and meaningful connections between memory and art as they emerge in our own lives. 

>Although it has been taken largely out of context, T.W. Adorno’s famous dictum – “to write poetry after Auschwitz is a barbaric act” – has set the terms of various debates about the literary responses to the Holocaust. More recently, it has been supplanted by other, productive debates about the overlapping, sometimes conflicting, concerns of memory and history. Holocaust literature has been at the center of questions about the limits of representation and the representation of pain, trauma, and survival. What are the connections between imaginative literature and history? How do we understand the documentary and testimonial impulse in much of Holocaust literature? How does this literature shape a contemporary sense of exile, diaspora, or home? How do these texts challenge our notions of national and linguistic borders?
